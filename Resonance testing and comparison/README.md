# Axis screw count comparison

The following will compare screw count of xy joints of a Voron 2.4 by taking out 1 screw on each side at a time.

(in this image from right to left until only the one on the left is there)

The main differences are measurable on the Y-axis

## Y-axis:
3 screws:

2 screws:

1 screw:

As you can see the recommended acceleration increases quite remakably when only using only 1 screw.

BUT Print Quality decreases drastically.
THis is because can shift around inside the XY joint.

if you're curious youll find x axis measurements [here](../Resources) but they are not remarkable.
