# Lightweight X Axis Mod for the Voron 2.4

**CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING**

This is meant to be as light and Strong as possible while not being too far from the stock machine.

This is derived from the [pinmod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod) and incorporates the [MGN12 mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/arkeet/mgn12) while using a Carbon fiber Square tube.

A third hole is added to the upper xy joints to provide more stiffness when mounting the Carbon fiber tube.

Required Hardware:
20x20 1mm wall thickness carbon fiber tube

- 4PCs 5x40mm Pin (Use Carbon fiber)
- 4PCs M5x40 SHCS
- 12PCs M5 Nut
- 4PCs M5x10 BHCS
- 2PCs M5x16 BHCS (or 2PCS M5x10 more if not using drag chains)
- 2PCs M5x30 BHCS

For Rail mounting:
M3x8 SHCS + Nuts for the amount of screws (4-8 Recommended) you want

the rest is stock

Using Aluminium Hardware for M5 is recommended (whatch out for the right alloy and heat treat! only use 7075 T6)


## Things to come
- MGN9 Support
- 20x20 1,5mm wall Carbon tube support
- Adjustability between XY joints and Carbon extrusion
- Rework M5 Nut holder inside the tube
- Tool to hold the M3 linear Rail nuts
- Umbilical Holder for Clockwork and Galileo (Chain Delete)
