# Carbonfiber-X-Axis
Lightweight X axis for the Voron 2.4

This is meant to be as light and Strong as possible while not being too far from the stock machine.

This is derived from the [pinmod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod) and incorporates the [MGN12 mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/arkeet/mgn12)

A third hole is added to the upper xy joints to provide more stiffness when mounting the Carbon fiber tube.
