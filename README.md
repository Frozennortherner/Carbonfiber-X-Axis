###Lightweight X axis mod for the Voron 2.4

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is meant to be as light and Strong as possible while not being too far from the stock machine.

This is derived from the [pinmod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_Pins_Mod) and incorporates the [MGN12 mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/arkeet/mgn12) while using a Carbon fiber Square tube.
